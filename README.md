# CubeTimer

This is a speedcubing timer to time your Rubik's cube solves.

To run, type 'java -jar CubeTimer.jar' on the command line.

When you run it, you will see a scramble and a time (0.00 to start).

Scramble your cube according the scramble sequence.

Press the space bar to start a 15 second countdown, while you look at your scrambled cube. 

Press it again to start the timer. Press it for a third time to stop the timer.

Pressing escape will allow you to change things such as the length of the timer, and the type of puzzle you are solving (for things other than a 3x3 Rubik's cube).
